% This code takes readings from the motion sensor every minute and
% averages them, to be used for detecting kitchen use.

% Store the channel IDs

% Provide the write API key.
writeKey = 'GIN15GMFJMR8VYZE';

% Reads the latest 30 readings from the motion data. The data is read
% every 20 seconds so this will constitute 10 minutes. This script
% is triggered to run every 10 minutes
[motion, time] = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID,'Fields',3,'Numpoints',30);

% Divides the data into arrays for each minute
motion1 = motion(1:6);
motion2 = motion(7:12);
motion3 = motion(13:18);
motion4 = motion(19:24);
motion5 = motion(25:30);

%stripping any NaN values that will break the code

motion3 = motion3';
motion3 = motion3(~isnan(motion3))';
motion4 = motion4';
motion4 = motion4(~isnan(motion4))';

% Calculate the average motion for each minute
avgMotion1 = mean(motion1);
avgMotion2 = mean(motion2);
avgMotion3 = mean(motion3);

%Creating arrays with the average motion for each minute and a timestamp
a = [avgMotion1; avgMotion2; avgMotion3; avgMotion4; avgMotion5];

% Write the average to the channel
